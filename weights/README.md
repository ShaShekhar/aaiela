- **Stable Diffusion v1.5 Inpainting:**
  - **File:** `sd-v1-5-inpainting.ckpt` and `ViT-L-14.pt`, download the weight files in this folder.
  - **Description:** Pre-trained weights for the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model, specifically fine-tuned for inpainting tasks.

**Important Notes**

- **License:** Make sure you comply with the licensing terms of the original model authors when using these weights. The licenses might vary for each model.
- **Custom Models:** If you've fine-tuned or trained your own models based on these weights, consider creating a separate folder to organize those.

Feel free to add more weight files as you use different models in your project. Keep this README updated to reflect the contents of the folder.
